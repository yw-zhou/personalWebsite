# FocusPocus

FocusPocus is an extension that extracts the contents you are browsing and through the Pytorch Libary and the text classification datasets in TorchText, it interprets and sorts them into categories for users to review. By selecting the extension, it will open up a dashboard with various stats on the how the user gets distracted. (An idea for the future would also be to display how to mitigate these distractions)

Currently I am learning and testing various algorithms (SVM, Naive Bayes, etc.) as well as training algorithms to see what would be the best solution for my idea above.
