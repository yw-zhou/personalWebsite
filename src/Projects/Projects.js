            Amidst the pandemic, social distancing is key to containing the
            spread. This means customers are wary of close interactions with
            staff and servers must walk great distances from table to table.
            Orderio is here to provide a solution.

            After pitching project Orderio, SalesPlus — a local POS software
            startup with over 20 restaurant clients — has decided to partner up,
            and introduce Orderio as the newest feature to their clients.
